It’s **Aeon** again—back with some more design notes regarding this week’s quest.\n\n\n\n\t• The ending of the last quest (The Burning Village) was originally part of this script, but I moved it back so you’d know about the enemy sooner, not later.\n\t• “Return to Lymcrest” takes place several weeks after “The Burning Village.” This quest happens right after that.\n\t• The little critter cameo is a callback to the early days of DF. If you don’t know what I’m talking about, see “Olaf’s Party” in Book 1 Dragesvard. The style of humor in that quest is really one of DF’s hallmarks.\n\t• The first thing the Hero teaches Falwynn in this quest: what number lesson do they start with?\n\t• Of all the quests in this arc, this was my favorite one to write. The atmosphere is silly and the dialogue flows smoothly—it’s just a cute quest overall.\n\nAnd since this week focuses on Falwynn, here’s some trivia about her:\n\n\n\n\t• Her birthday is April 7th (**based on our calendar, not the in-game one!**).\n\t• Her favorite color is ultraviolet, a color she can’t even see. Her next favorite is green.\n\t• She was based on Linkle, a character from The Legend of Zelda series.\n\nThat’s all for this week! Again, thanks for reading—and see you next time!\n\nHead over to **Book 3 Falconreach** and talk to **Ash** to continue the **Six Heroes Saga**!\n\n[Image 1 (\"No title\")]\n\n\n\n\nHey there heroes!\n\nVerlryrus here with a bunch of fixes and changes going live this week.\n\nFixed: \"Magic\" dragon feeding in Bk1 Celestia's Grove numbers not appearing properly.\nFixed: Stealth Lovey Bear in new Sir Jing's Weapons quest.\nFixed: Mutant Caves; issue with final room when map generated a certain way.\nFixed: Fallen Ice Dragon weapons now have properly functioning specials.\nFixed: Jova's weapons now have properly functioning specials. \nAdjusted: Jova's weapons bonus damage normalized to +30% (from +50%), in line with Fallen Ice Dragon and Escelence DC items.\n\nAdjusted: Riftwalker's Fade now gives M/P/M defense instead of B/P/D avoidance.\nFixed: Riftwalker's Fade now properly gives 2 turns of damage boost (was incorrectly giving only 1).\nFixed: GPS MkII now has skill descriptions for Burn and Selfdestruct.\n\nAdjusted: Hard Mode enemies no longer have an innate 20% chance to ignore stun/immobility effects.\n\nAdjusted: Zard Cuisine from the Zardbie war (Mogloween Book accessible).\n    Tartare: 20% Boost for 5 turns\n    Legs: Crit +50 (25%) for 5 turns\n    Cakes: LUK + 40 for 5 turns\n    Kebobs: Bonus +100 for 5 turns\n    All: Stuffed for 30 turns (up from 5)\n\nAdjusted: Arena at the Edge of Time gold rewards significantly increased for the following challenges:\n    Dragonoid\n    Siofra\n    Theano\n    Elemental Chaos\n    Centaur Abomination\n    Cauldron Groupies\n    Jack Crescent (and Guitar)\n    Legion Crawler\n    Crawler & Centaur\n    Random Blood Moon Challenge\n    Sir Bearginion, Most Honorable Duelist of the Western Deepwoods, Also Known As One Punch Bear\n    Leorilla\n    Weird Duo\n    Super Sentog Justice Go!\n    Groundhog Dave\n    Big & Small\n\nAdjusted: All \"final tier\" challenges now cost 1000 gold to attempt.

I look around and everywhere I see people frantically going about: final desperate preparations for final exams, tripidating plannings for trips for the holidays, anticipation for friend and family gatherings left, right, up, down and everywhere in between.\n\nSpeaking of family gatherings, have you ever had that one family member who is always in the worst of moods while everyone is trying to have a good time? If you have, Moroz might feel a bit familiar. One would think that after all the effort the Hero and co. have gone through to accommodate him he could warm up a bit… Is it the fact that they are all strangers? Possibly… The fact you showed up uninvited? Maybe but still… Is there something else that that's riling Moroz? Doesn't seem so. He really seems unnecessarily sour. Sour as an unripened moglinberry.\n\n [Image 1 (\"No title\")]\n\nAll in all perhaps he is just a lumberjack through and through: as sharp as the blade of his axe and as stiff as the bark of the trees he cuts down all at the same time.\n\nFor those full of impatience and expectations for a white Falconreach, Snowy Falconreach will come in January as Verly and Tomix get a bit of rest for the epic job they have done on releases this year!\n\nI’m dreeeaming of a white Frostvaaal…\n\nHave fun and enjoy the holidays!\n\n**~Elryn**\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHey guys, Tomix here.\n\nUnfortunatelly I was not able to finish up snowy Falconreach this week... so it'll be coming out at a later date, very soon!\n\n","imageLinks":["https://cms.aqworlds.com/df/images/22-12-2017.png"]}]
